# Todo List

This is a Todo List project implemented using web technologies: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The purpose of this application is to allow users to create, manage, and track a list of tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks: Users can add a new task to the list by providing a title and a description.
- Remove tasks: Users have the option to remove a task from the list if it is no longer needed.
- Local storage: The application utilizes the browser's local storage feature to persist tasks, allowing users to resume their activities even after closing the browser.

## DOM Manipulation

DOM manipulation is used to interact with HTML elements on the page. This includes dynamically creating elements, updating content, adding and removing classes, and handling events. JavaScript is responsible for this interaction, enabling the addition, removal, and updating of elements in the Todo List.

## Local Storage

To ensure data persistence, the application utilizes local storage, a browser feature that allows data to be stored on the client-side. Tasks are stored locally, enabling users to access the list even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.
